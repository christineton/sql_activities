Class - Sept 21th
For this class there was a more solidified understanding of the foundations to write based statements. I was able to gain a better understanding of how to perform subqueries and further my learnings in inner and outer joins. There was also a deeper focus on understanding table design and database management.  This is very useful as there are a lot of tables and databases created at work so I am able to understand our tables create at work and how they are organized.
