-- Instructions

-- Using subqueries, identify all actors who appear in the film Alter Victory in the sakila database.

SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE actor_id IN
(
	SELECT actor_id
    FROM film_actor
    WHERE film_id IN 
    ( 
    SELECT film_id
    FROM film
    WHERE title = 'ALTER VICTORY'
    )
);

-- Using subqueries, display the titles of films that the employee, Jon Stephens, rented to customers.
SELECT title
	FROM film
	WHERE film_id
	IN (
		SELECT film_id
			FROM inventory
			WHERE inventory_id
			IN (
				SELECT inventory_id
					FROM rental
					WHERE staff_id
						IN (
							SELECT staff_id
								FROM staff
								WHERE last_name = "Stephens" AND first_name = "Jon"
							)
				)
		);




-- Bonus

-- For problem No. 2, refine the Jon Stephens query to select for films that were rented on May 31st, and whose titles begin with the letter C.
-- Hint: you may wish to look into using wildcards in MySQL.
