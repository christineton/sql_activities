# sql_activities

Class - Sept 22th
This class was establishing a connection with SQL database using SQL Alchemy.  We went in dept in performing basic SQL queries using engine.exeute().  

Also in this section I was able to learn how to create Python classes and objects.  These are used a lot by Data Scientists at my work so being able to understand how these are iterated was very helpful. 

I was able to create, read, and update, along with create data from a SQL database using SQLAlchemy's ORM. 

Very in-depth class diving into SQL and Python.
