# sql_activities


Class - Sept 17th
I enjoyed learning about the basics of SQL such as creating tables, establishing variables, adding rows, and identifying unique values.  Usually at work I work with databases and tables that are already created, but this really helps me break down my understanding of what is being done. 

I found the most difficult part has been ensuring the correct databases are set up and using our local computer for this part. Since I took the class remotely I had a bit of time trying to figure this out but was able to resolve it. 

My understanding of SQL is that it is made for us to better analyze large sets of data and write queries on what we would like to analyze from this data. I am excited to see how we can work with large data set and what would possibilities there can be with SQL.
