Class - Sept 17th
The first introduction into MySQL Workbench 

We were able to create a localhost connection to a MySQL server 

We then created, used, and populated a MySQL database within this data. 

We were able to create, populate, and select data from a MySQL table 

Great first introduction as the very simple basics of MySQL and how to create tables and data. 

I really look forward to diving deeper into this section.
